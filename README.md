# Disable-billing-address-fields-in-WooCommerce without plugin
The standard WooCommerce checkout fields are ok, but I guess you'd like to customize the form a little bit.  For example, you may want to remove billing and shipping fields, rearrange them.


copy this code and paste it in function.php .
I preffer paste it in child theme.
